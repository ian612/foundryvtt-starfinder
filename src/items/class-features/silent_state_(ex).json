This lasts until you end it as a swift action, take damage that causes you to lose Hit Points, or fail a Will saving throw. While in your silent state, you gain no benefits from the aid another, covering fire, and harrying fire actions, and you take a â€“2 penalty to attacks and checks to perform these actions. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against emotion, fear, mind-affecting, pain, sense-dependent, and sonic effects, increasing to +3 at 9th level and +4 at 15th level. When your silent state ends, you receive a burst of insight, and can apply the insight bonus granted by the channel skill class ability (+1 at 1st level) to the next skill check you attempt before the end of your next turn.</span></p>"
