Each power core also generates some excess energy, measured as Power Points (PP; see TR, page 113), which an operator can expend to enhance the mech’s performance and execute extraordinary maneuvers. Each power core has: a rate, representing the number of PP it generates at the end of its turn; an initial value, representing the number of PP a mech has when it begins an encounter; and a maximum (shown in parentheses), representing the maximum PP the core can store during combat. A mech can use only a single power core.</p>\n<p>Optionally, a power core can acquire one power core template that modifies some of its statistics or provides additional ways to generate or use Power Points.</p>"
