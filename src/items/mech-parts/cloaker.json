The mech gains the ability to attempt Stealth checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Fade (0 PP)</strong> As a full action, the mech initiates active camouflage, granting it concealment until it makes an attack or performs other harmful actions, at which point the effect ends. If the mech begins combat while this ability is active, it begins the encounter with 1 less PP (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Cloak (4 PP)</strong> As a standard action, the mech fades from view as per invisibility. The effect lasts for 1 round, though the mech can extend the duration each round by expending 1 PP. The effect ends if the mech makes an attack or performs other harmful actions.</p>"
